Example 1: Find the direction of the vector (1, -√3) using the direction of a vector formula.

Solution:

Given (x, y) = (1, -√3).

We first find α using α = tan-1 |y/x|.

α = tan-1 |-√3/1| = tan-1 √3 = 60°.

We know that (1, -√3) lies in quadrant 4. Thus, the direction of the given vector is,

θ = 360 - α = 360 - 60 = 300°.

Answer: The direction of the given vector = 300°.
